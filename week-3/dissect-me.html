        Version Control

        Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Every projects evolves in little steps. This can happen by adding files, deleting files, improving content, adding modifications and many other things can be done to your project. Each of these steps is basically a new version of your project and each version can be saved to a repository.

        Repository

        A repository is a sort of database which will contain all your commit objects. A commit object will be made of a set of files that reflect the state of the project at that given point in time, the user made a commit(i.e a snapshot of the project at that time). It will contain references to parent commit objects, which are the commits that were edited to produce the previous state of the project. Finally, it will contain unique identifier for the commit object.

        Benefits of Version Control?

        Version Control saves your project in a professional way without needing to create new folders or create a copy of your entire project. For example, if a file hasn't changed the Version Control Git doesn't store the file, it will just provide a link to the file as it was saved in the previous commit. Version Control keeps track of when changes are made, by whom, the date and time as well as recording a message for the commit that will typically explain the what and why the change was done. Version Control allows you to see what was changed at a glance. Version control also allows you to restore previous versions of your project. With the concept of branches, Version Control Git allows you to work on new features more safely. A branch is similar to looking at a  copy of your project in a new folder with which you can safely play with before applying those changes back into the orginal project. Version Control really helps you collaborate with other people without fear of overwriting issues.

        Workflow of Git to keep track of changes

        Git keeps track of changes as follows. When you modify a file on your working directory, you can then stage the file in the staging area by using the command line "git add". This creates a snapshot of your file at that point in time. When you are ready to commit the change, you do a commit which will store the snapshot of the file in the Git directory.

        Git uses three states for a  file : modified, staged and commited.

        GitHub a remote repository

        GitHub is basically a cloud repository while Git is local to your computer. The advantage of this it that you can have other people access your code and add changes/improvements to it. GitHub allows you the opportunity to work and study on project of other people.
