#h1 How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

It allows you to inspect each element and make changes. These changes are automatically reflected. This is of great help to see the new position and/or format.

#h1 How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

The DOM allows us to expose different nodes of the HTML file. At each node we can see the related CSS and make adjustments there.

#h1 What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
Relative is positioned relative to its normal position.
Fixed is positioned relative to the viewport.
Absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

#h1What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

It is just the relative position with respect to content

Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

#h1What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I found it to be a playfull challenge
