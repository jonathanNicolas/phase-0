# release1
# What are these methods doing? Initializes age,name,occupation. reads them then changes them.
# How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables? there are two methods change_my and what_is, the first one passes a new argument and assigns it to an instance variable. The second one returns the instance variable.

# release2
# What changed between the last release and this release?The what_is_age method was altered with an attr reader method.
# What was replaced? what_is_age methog
# Is this code simpler than the last?yes

# Is this code simpler than the last?yes



# Reflection
# What is a reader method? a method that returns instance variable
# What is a writer method? a method that writes instance variable
# What do the attr methods do for you?methods are already defined with attr no need to start from scratch
# Should you always use an accessor to cover your bases? Why or why not?No. Sometimes you want reader or writer specifically
