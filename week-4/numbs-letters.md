#What does puts do?

#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a number without decimals, a float is a number with decimals.
#What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the
difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
An integer division will round down the value you would be getting if you used a float division. For example if a bar of kikat is worth 2$ and you have 9$ with you , you would not be able to buy 4.5 kitkats but 4 kitkat bars. 4.5 would be the answer you would get using a float divistion 9.0/2.0 and 4 would be the answer you would get using the interger divition 9/2.

#How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Pretty much the same way a calculator does. You just need to be specific about using floats or integers.
#What is the difference between integers and floats?
Integers are whole numbers while floats are decimals.
#What is the difference between integer and float division?
an integer division will round down your answer while a float division will give you the exact answer.
#What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
strings are a group of letters
#What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
local variables are specific to your block of code and doesn't apply to the entire program
