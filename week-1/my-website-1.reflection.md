To create a repository on GitHub you go to your GitHub account page, on the upper right corner you click "+" then select New repository. This will prompt you to give a name to it, decide if you want it public or private, you can also initialize it with a Readme file as well as add an MIT license among other options. Once appropriate options have been chosen just clock create repository. To close this repository to your local computer just copy the url and then go to your comand line and type : git clone url.

Open source code are made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

Open source sounds like utopia for me and exciting the fact that you can participate in the any open source project. It is a great way to gain experience prior to work or while working and to expand your horizons.

Open source license allows a software to be freely used. Since copyright is automatic in the US, adding the MIT license for example to your repository will enable others to help you.

I had a "aha" moment when I finally understood branching and managing the branches. I found an excelent source online git-scm.com which cleared a lot of my confusion when it came to using Git.
