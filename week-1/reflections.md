#Through these videos and texts, I have learned how meditation, mindfulness and creating habits increase productivity. I particularly liked the counter-intuitive productivity part, because I have a tendency to write down everything I need to do for the day then go through the list. I actually think now that starting the day not having the feeling to need to accomplish everything, might be a more wholesome approach. To start at a micro level, doing two minutes of an important task to get the ball rolling is very interesting and I assume you just let it roll from there. As for time-management the pomodoro technique was also very interesting, giving yourself specific time and stop the task and see where you are at and improve your time management from there. Currently I ballpark the amount of time I need to accomplish a task and hope I finish on time which usually I do but keeping track of time especially when learning something new will be very beneficial. I plan on using this pomodoro technique for the phase 0 assignment, short , medium and long to time myself and slowly get a better sense of how much time will be needed for assignments. My overall plan is still not very clear as this is week 0. I will start with keeping track of time for the assignments and not get overwhelmed by approaching things in a micro level to not get stuck too long on a specific part that needs to be completed for the week.

##The implementation of a Unix command-line environment is known as a shell. There are various types of shell and in the case of Apple, it uses one called a Bash. Bash is accessed by launching the application Terminal.

##The most challenging part was getting to understand where I actually was at any given point in time after completing a command. Since I am used to working with a user interface in windows or mac and see the folders and open them, this was very new to me.

##I was able to complete most commands. I did run into one issue where I wanted to remove a directory but it couldn't do it because the directory wasn't empty. I used the ls command and nothing was inside of it. That confused me and I ended deleting the directory manually by searching it on my computer. Besides that it was ok.

##As a first time user the most important commands for me were pwd, ls, cd because those commands helped me understand where I was and what I was looking at. Going forward I see rm, mv, cp, rmdir as important ones as well in order to move, copy and delete files or directories. The pushd and popd seem also very usefull in helping you move along the stack quickly and work on different things at the same time.

##pwd - this prints out your current working directory

##ls - lists out all that is in your current directory

##mv - allows you to move or rename a file

##cd - allows to change directory either directly or step by step. you can jump to specific directories or home if needed

##../ - means the parent of the current directory

##touch - creates an empty file

##mkdir - this makes a new directory

##less - this displays your file

##rmdir - removes a directory

##rm - removes a file

##help - allows your to search for what commands do

### To create a new repo on GitHub, click the "+" sign on the upper right corner of any page the click new repository. From there it will prompt you to different options like naming the repository or making public/private. It is also possible to initialise it with a Readme file.

###Forking a repo allows you to freely experiment with a copy of the project. You need to navigate to the desired repository and on top right corner there is a green "fork" looking sign, just click it.

###Finally, to clone it all you need to do is copy the url then go to your Bash and type git clone and paste the url location.

###Setting up Git and GitHub was straightforward and I did not encounter any issues.
